Muon Analysis 2
################

New Features
------------
- The plotting logic within the Muon Analysis 2 GUI has updated to prevent all the workspaces from a
  fit being plotted at the same time. Instead, the choice of which fit workspace to plot can be made in
  fitting and sequential fitting tabs.
- When the user switches to the fitting tab, the workspace present in the fit display box is plotted.
  To switch back to a view of all the data, the user can switch to the home, grouping or phase table tabs.
- The sequential fitting table now allows multiple selections to be made.
- Addition of an external plotting button to the Muon Analysis 2 GUI.
  This allows the user to create a standalone Workbench (or MantidPlot) plot of the displayed data.
  The user may then perform standard operations on the plot, e.g drag and drop workspaces onto the figure.
- On the fitting tab, only one fit object (fit output and input workspaces) will be shown at a time.

Improvements
-------------
- Improved the plotting code the Muon Analysis interface, with a significant amount of redundant code removed.
  This code improvement will lead to more maintainable code, which will be more stable and
  easier to add new functionality in the future.
- Improved the maintainability of the fitting code in the Muon Analysis interface by removing redundant and duplicated code.
  These changes will make the addition of new functionality in the future easier.
- The plot guess option within the fitting tab will now update when a parameter is changed.
